	### Task 6: Getting user input and comments

		# Print "Hello, world!" on the screen:
		print('Hello, world!')
		# Get the user's name from their keyboard input:

	### Task 7: Converting celsius to fahrenheit

		temp_in_celsius = int(input('Enter the temperature in celsius\n'))
		temp_in_fahrenheit = (temp_in_celsius * 9)/5 + 32
		print('The temperature in fahrenheit is ' + str(temp_in_fahrenheit))

	* The formula for converting to fahrenheit is 
	$$ \text{fahrenheit} = \frac{9}{5} \times \text{celsius} + 32$$
	* Using this formula, we can write the program shown above
	* Explain your results
