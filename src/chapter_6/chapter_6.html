	A formula is needed to do a calculation and must start with an = sign.

	* =17+31
	* =8*5
	* =15/3

	You can also use formula to do calculation on cells.

	* =C20*E20
	* =A15+A17

	Functions allow you to work on a lot of data at once
	* **SUM:** Allows you to add many items
	* **COUNTA:** Counts how many filled up cells are there
	* **MAX:** Finds the highest value
	* **MIN:** Finds the lowest value
	* **AVERAGE:** Finds the average value of a set of data

	### Task 3

	* Make a spreadsheet on the *10 richest people in the world*
	* Use functions to find their **average age** and their **average wealth**.
	* Use functions to find the **total wealth** held by all the people in the list.

	### Task 4
	* Make a spreadsheet for the *10 poorest countries in the world by GDP*
	* In a column add the **GDP per capita** for each country
	* In another column, add the **population size** for each country
	* Add another column called **Total GDP** and calculate it as $\text{Total GDP} = \text{GDP Per capita} \times \text{population size}$
	* Find the **average GDP** of each country using functions.

<section data-markdown>
	### Task 5

	* Add the names of 5 movies to a spreadsheet.
	* Make columns for their **production budget** and **gross earnings**
	* Add a column called **profit**
	* Use a formula to calculate the profit each movie made as $\text{gross earnings} - \text{production budget}$
	* Use functions to calculate the highest and lowest profit of all the movies in the list.

<section data-markdown>
	* **Sort:** Allows you to sort items A to Z or Z to A
	* **Filter:** Allows you to easily find data
	* **COUNTIF:** Find how many of a certain value there are 
	* **IF:** Analyse data for a TRUE or FALSE as two outcomes

	A primary source of data is a source you have collected yourself
	A secondary source of data is a source which you have found and decided to use
	If a secondary source is used, it must always be referenced in your work

	Which one of these is an example of a primary source?
	Interview
	Newspaper
