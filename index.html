					### 1.5 Digital Text and Numbers
					
					##### How do computers recognize text and numbers?

					* Any computer can understand only binary numbers
					* This means that even the letters of the alphabet have to be a binary number to make sense to the computer
					* **ASCII** is a widely used system to convert the alphabet (and numerals) to binary numbers.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### 1.5 Digital Text and Numbers
					
					##### What is ASCII?
					* **ASCII** (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) is a system that computers use to represent text.
					* Each letter, number, and symbol on your keyboard has its own special number in the ASCII code.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### 1.5 Digital Text and Numbers
					* For example:
						* The letter 'A' is represented by the number 65.
						* The letter 'a' is represented by the number 97.
						* The number '1' is represented by the number 49.
					* The **standard ASCII** system includes 128 codes, ranging from 0 to 127. 
					* There is also an **extended ASCII** system that includes 256 codes.
					* These codes include letters, numbers, punctuation marks, and control characters (like newline)
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### 1.5 Digital Text and Numbers
					* Each ASCII character is represented in binary (base 2) inside the computer. For example, the letter 'A' (65 in decimal) is 01000001 in binary.
					* The problem with ASCII is that there are only 256 characters
					* This is because ASCII was originally created to deal with English
					* An improved code called **Unicode** was invented in 1991 to deal with other languages

					Homework: What is different in how ASCII and Unicode store characters?

					### 1.5 Digital Text and Numbers

					In total, there are 256 ASCII characters, and can be broadly divided into three categories:

					* **ASCII control characters:** 0-31 and 127
					* **ASCII printable characters:** 32-126
					* **Extended ASCII characters:** 128-255

					**Example:** 127 is the DEL (delete) control character.

					**Example:** 128 is an extended ASCII character and represents the Euro sign €

					### 1.6 Sound and Vision
					##### Q. What are pixels?

					* If you get your eyes close to a screen, you might see it is made up of little dots that are lined up in horizontal and vertical rows across and up and down the screen surface.

					* These dots are referred to as **pixels**.
					* A pixel means *picture element*. 
					* Each pixel contains red, green, and blue colors: referred to as **subpixels**.

					##### Q. What is resolution?
					* The number of pixels that can be displayed on a screen determines the **resolution** of the displayed images.
					> $$\text{Total number of pixels} = \text{no. of horizontal pixels} \times \text{no. of vertical pixels}$$

					This total is referred to as **pixel density**.

					### 1.6 Sound and Vision
					##### Q. How are images stored in the computer?
					* A computer can only store $1$'s and $0$'s
					* To encode an image in a computer, there is a bit for every colour in a pixel.
					* If the bit is $1$, the colour will be *added* to the final image, if it is $0$ the colour will be left out.
					* For more colours, you need to use more bits for each pixel

					### 1.6 Sound and Vision
					##### Q. What is colour depth and true colour?

					* An image becomes more realistic if we add more colours
					* The number of colours (bits) used to describe an image is known as **colour depth**
					* **True colour** means that atleast $256$ colours are used to describe the image
					* An image will be realistic if it has atleast a colour depth of *true colour*.

					### 1.6 Sound and Vision
					##### Q. What is Analog Audio and Digital Audio?
					* **Analog audio** is a continuous wave that fluctuates in response to sound waves from a vibrating object
					* **Digital audio** is a sound that has been encoded into a digital format, which can be stored and processed by computers. 
					* Digital audio is stored as binary code that represent the audio waveform.

					### What is Python?

					* Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. 
					* **high-level:** means it is easier to use than other programming languages
					* **general-purpose:** means it can be used to make almost any kind of application
					* It was created by *Guido van Rossum* as a beginner friendly programming language

					**Note:** We use version 3.0 of Python, also called **python3**
					
					Version 2.0 of Python, called **python2** is also commonly used.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### Task 0: Register a compiler
					
					* Log in to your google account

					* Whenever you start learning a programming language, you almost always start with a *Hello, world!* program. 
					* This is a very basic program that just tells the computer to show the words *Hello, world!* in the console.
					* Doing this is a long-held tradition in any programming community.
					* To tell the computer to show words on the screen using *python*, we use the **print()** function.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### Task 1: Hello World


						print("Hello, world!")

					* Type the above line in the code window
					* Press **Ctrl-S** to save, and click the green **Run** button
					* Observe the output in the console  



					### Exercise: Printing
						print()
					* Add the above line to your code
					* Add a line to your program to show the words "I am going to take over the world!" in the console.

					**Note:** Python runs code from top to bottom
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### Exercise: Printing longer text

					* Use the **print()** function to print longer pieces of text
					* Type **\n** between some words to go to the next line.
					
					**\n** is known as a *newline* character
					
					### Task 3: Printing numbers and calculating
						print(42)
						print(3.14)
						print(1 + 2)
						print(7 - 5)
						print(4 * 8)
						print(10 / 5)
					* Type out the above code
					* Try to explain the result

					### Task 8: Converting celsius to fahrenheit
						temp_in_celsius = input('Enter the temperature in celsius\n')
						temp_in_fahrenheit = (temp_in_celsius * 9)/5 + 32
						print('The temperature in fahrenheit is ' + temp_in_fahrenheit)

					* The formula for converting to fahrenheit is 
					$$ \text{fahrenheit} = \frac{9}{5} \times \text{celsius} + 32$$
					* Using this formula, we can write the program shown above
					* Explain your results
